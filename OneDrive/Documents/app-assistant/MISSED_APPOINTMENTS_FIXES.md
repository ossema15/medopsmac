# MedOps PatientPanel and Walk-in Notifications Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Patients with Today's Appointments Not Showing in PatientPanel

**Problem**: When appointments were booked for a specific day, the PatientPanel (today's patients) would only display patients created today, not patients who have appointments scheduled for today.

**Root Cause**: The `getTodayPatients()` function only returned patients created today (`DATE(created_at) = ?`), but patients with appointments scheduled for today wouldn't appear if they were created on a different day.

**Solution**: Modified the database query in `app/database/database.js` to include patients with appointments scheduled for today, regardless of when the patient was created:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.* FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN appointments a ON p.id = a.patient_id
WHERE DATE(p.created_at) = ? 
   OR (a.appointment_date = ? AND a.status IN ('scheduled', 'missed', 'waiting', 'walk_in_notified'))
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
```

This ensures that:
- Patients created today appear (original behavior)
- Patients with appointments scheduled for today appear (new behavior)
- Includes appointments with status: scheduled, missed, waiting, and walk_in_notified

**Expected Behavior**: When you book an appointment for a specific day, that patient will appear in the PatientPanel on that specific day, regardless of when the patient was originally created.

### 2. Walk-in Notifications Looping

**Problem**: Walk-in notifications kept reappearing in a loop because they were being marked with status 4, but the appointment notification service kept creating new ones.

**Root Cause**: The walk-in notification system was auto-removing notifications after 3 seconds but not properly tracking which appointments had already triggered notifications, causing them to re-trigger.

**Solution**: Implemented a proper tracking system:

1. **Modified `src/renderer/js/services/appointmentNotificationService.js`**:
   - Added logic to mark appointments as `'walk_in_notified'` when a walk-in notification is created
   - Updated the filter to exclude appointments already marked as `'walk_in_notified'`
   - Added a utility function to reset notification status for testing

2. **Modified `src/renderer/js/App.js`**:
   - Updated `removeWalkinNotification()` to properly handle walk_in notifications
   - Added logic to mark appointments as 'missed' when walk-in notifications are closed

3. **Status Flow**:
   - `scheduled` → `walk_in_notified` (when notification is created)
   - `walk_in_notified` → `missed` (when notification is closed/removed)

## Files Modified

1. **`app/database/database.js`**
   - Updated `getTodayPatients()` query to include patients with today's appointments

2. **`src/renderer/js/services/appointmentNotificationService.js`**
   - Added tracking for walk-in notifications
   - Added `resetWalkInNotificationStatus()` utility function

3. **`src/renderer/js/App.js`**
   - Updated `removeWalkinNotification()` to handle walk_in notifications properly

4. **`src/renderer/js/pages/PatientPanel.js`**
   - Added debugging to help track patient loading

## Testing

A test script `test-fixes.js` has been created to verify the fixes:

```javascript
// Run in browser console to test
runAllTests();                           // Run all tests
testPatientsWithTodayAppointments();      // Test patients with today's appointments
testMissedAppointments();                // Test missed appointments
testWalkInNotifications();               // Test walk-in notifications
resetWalkInNotifications();              // Reset for testing
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **PatientPanel**: Patients with appointments scheduled for today will now appear in the PatientPanel, regardless of when the patient was created

2. **Walk-in Notifications**: 
   - Notifications will appear once when appointments are 1 minute late
   - Notifications will auto-remove after 3 seconds
   - Notifications will not re-appear in a loop
   - Appointments will be marked as 'missed' when notifications are closed

## Status Values

- `scheduled`: Appointment is scheduled and hasn't triggered notifications yet
- `walk_in_notified`: Walk-in notification has been created for this appointment
- `missed`: Appointment was missed (notification was closed)
- `waiting`: Patient is waiting
- `completed`: Appointment was completed

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Existing appointments will continue to work as expected
- The system now properly tracks notification states to prevent loops
- Patients with appointments scheduled for today will be visible in the PatientPanel for proper patient management
